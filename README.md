# OpenCourier
OpenCourier is a developer-first messaging platform that clones Twilio’s core sending capability and adds two key improvements: a Pull Inbox that eliminates the need for webhook infrastructure to receive messages, and a Billing Intelligence Dashboard that gives developers real-time visibility and control over their usage-based costs.
